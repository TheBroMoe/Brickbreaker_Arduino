Final Group Project: Brickbreaker

Game Description:
The goal of the game is player must smash a wall of bricks by deflecting a bouncing ball with a paddle.
The paddle may move horizontally and is controlled with the joystick, the
When all the bricks have been destroyed, a victory screen is displayed.

The developement of this project consisted of 5 major milestones:
1. Implementing the movement of the ball and the paddle

2. Creating a two-dimensional array holding a structure with characteristics of the brick

3. Working on the collision mechanics of the walls, the borders, as well as the paddle

4. Creating a series of menus and display screens with messages to the player that involved
	interaction using the touchscreen

5. Small additions, including
* a life counter (how many balls left in one play session)
* Difficulty selection (easy or hard mode which adjusts the balls velocity)
*Instruction menu

Acknowledgements:
	*	Used code developed in class for the paddles movement
	* Received Help from Jason Cannon on how to develop two dimensional arrays
	* For paddle collision, received help from Songhui Zhang
Accessories:
* 1x Arduino Mega Board (AMG)
* 1x Joystick
* 1x LCD Display

Wiring Instructions:
 REFER TO WIRING INSTRUCTIONS IN ECLASS FOR SCREEN WIRING
 Joystick wiring:
Arduino GND <--> GND
Arduino 5V <--> 5V
Arduino Analogue pin A1 <--> VRx
Arduino Analogue pin A0 <--> VRy
Arduino Pin 2 <--> SW

How to run code:
* Make sure wiring is correct:
* Ensure lcd_image.cpp and .h are in the file with Brickbreaker.cpp
* Compile using make and upload using make upload and run program

Reccomendations to individuals who wish to repeat project:

* Determine how you want to organise the properties of the bricks
* Work out the collision physics and refine them as much as possible.
	There are many sources online that can help with this
